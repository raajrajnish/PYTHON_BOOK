# Python [Class](https://docs.python.org/3.11/glossary.html#term-class)

A template for creating user-defined objects. Class definitions normally contain method definitions which operate on instances of the class.

## Naming Convention [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#class-names)

- Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.
- Function and Variable Names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
- Function and Method Arguments.
     - If a function argumentâ€™s name clashes with a reserved keyword, it is generally better to append a single trailing
       underscore rather than use an abbreviation or spelling corruption. Thus class_ is better than clss.
- Always use self for the first argument to instance methods.
- Always use cls for the first argument to class methods.
