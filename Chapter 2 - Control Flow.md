# Chapter 2 - Control Flow

Control flow in Python refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program. It allows you to control the flow of execution based on conditions and loop structures. 

- **Conditional Statements (if-else)**: In the below example, the program checks the value of variable x. If it's greater than 0, it prints "Positive number". If it's less than 0, it prints "Negative number". Otherwise, if it's equal to 0, it prints "Zero".

  '''
  x = 10

  if x > 0:
      print("Positive number")
  elif x < 0:
      print("Negative number")
  else:
      print("Zero")
  '''
